## Score as Tie Breaker

The attendees ranked the flavors by scoring each flavor on a scale from 1 to
5. The goal of this exercise is to use the total score for the flavor as the
primary tie breaker for the LaCroix flavor rating.

### Setup:

1. Add the updated sample-input.txt with the score data to the candidate's repository.
2. Add the updated expected-output.txt with the updated ranking to the candidate's repository.
3. Commit the changes.

If the candidate asks what happens if the total score is still equal, inform
them that shortest name sorting can remain as the secondary tie breaker.
